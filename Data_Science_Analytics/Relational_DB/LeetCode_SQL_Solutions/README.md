# LeetCode & Data Platform SQL Solutions


## 🎯 Purpose
This folder contains **executable SQL solutions** to problems from LeetCode, and other technical interview platforms. Each `.txt` file represents a complete, tested solution that has been **accepted by the respective platform's submission system**.

## 📝 Why Text Files?
- **Platform Compatibility:** All coding platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank, DataLemur, etc.) accept `.txt` format for SQL submissions.
- **Version Control Friendly:** Plain text files are lightweight and diff-friendly for Git.
- **Universal Readability:** Can be opened on any system without special software.
- **Direct Copy-Paste:** Solutions can be directly pasted into online judges or IDEs.

## 🛠️ File Naming Convention
Files follow this pattern:  
`Platform_ProblemNumber_Difficulty_ProblemName.txt`

Example: `LeetCode_180_MEDIUM_ConsecutiveNumbers.txt`

## 📊 Current Problem Set

| File | Platform | Problem # | Difficulty | Description |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| `DataLemur__MEDIUM_HistogramOfTweets.txt` | DataLemur | - | MEDIUM| Analyze tweet frequency distribution |
| `LeetCode_178_MEDIUM_RankScores.txt` | LeetCode | 178 | MEDIUM | Ranking scores with ties |
| `LeetCode_180_MEDIUM_ConsecutiveNumbers.txt` | LeetCode | 180 | MEDIUM | Find consecutive numbers appearing times |
| `LeetCode_182_EASY_DuplicateEmails.txt` | LeetCode | 182 | EASY | Identify duplicate email addresses |
| `LeetCode_183_EASY_CustomersWhoNeverOrder.txt` | LeetCode | 183 | EASY | Find customers with no orders |

## ✅ Validation & Testing
Each solution has been:
1. **Tested** against the platform's test cases.
2. **Accepted** by the submission system.
3. **Optimized** for performance (where applicable).
4. **Commented** for clarity and learning.



## 📈 Skills Demonstrated
- **Advanced SQL Querying:** Window functions, joins, aggregations.
- **Problem-Solving:** Algorithmic thinking applied to database problems.
- **Performance Optimization:** Efficient query design.
